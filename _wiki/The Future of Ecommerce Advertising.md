The Future of Ecommerce Advertising: 

Collecting and leveraging 1st Party Data.

Here’s how you can get ahead of 99% of brands and turn your site traffic into a thought idea machine for all future marketing campaigns and new product launches:

The tides are turning.

Whilst platforms such as FB held all the power with 3rd party data, the new opportunity is for brands that bring data in-house.

First, let’s take a step back.

How do you build a successful Ecommerce brand?

1) Find a community of like-minded people
2) Identify the biggest problem they all have
3) Offer a product which provides the solution
4) Get feedback from the group and improve the product
5) Test marketing messages through organic social
6) Find product-market fit
7) Scale it out to the masses through paid social
8) Create complementary products to increase LTV

The old playbook:

-Wait to see the data brought  to your site (FB)
-People view ads, visit site and some buy products 
-Optimize your customer journey to increase efficiency

But the price of attention is only going up.

To combat this, we need a new approach.

The new playbook:

-Find your ideal customers (through content)
-Know what products your customers want next
-Answer your ideal customer's objections through a hyper-personalised customer journey, segmented by different avatars

Shifting the power back into your hands, the brand.

If you have existing customers/site traffic, you need a mechanism to turn data into answers.

Here’s the 4 step framework: 


Step 1: Activate the Inputs

People appreciate community more than ever.

Take them on your journey - they’ll give you all the answers.

- Start interviewing your top customers
- Install pre and post-purchase surveys
- Give customers a reason to give a review

The more inputs you have, the bigger your competitive advantage will be.


Step 2: House Your Data

Data alone will do nothing. It’s how you store it, filter it and then implement it.

Create a spreadsheet/split into these categories:

-Objections
-Feedback
-Benefits
-Stories
-Proof

Then integrate your data inputs into this sheet.

The more inputs you have, the more segmentation you can do.


Step 3: Analysis

At this point, you’ll have the answers.

Now you need to start seeing the patterns.

-Themes from life-changing stories using your products
-Recurring language your ideal customers use
-Common reasons people don’t buy


Step 4: Implementation

This is the fun part. 

Start using your data for:

- Testing new content ideas/ads
- Split testing copy on landing pages
- New product ideas and packaging

Take personalization to a whole new level.


TL;DR:

Step 1: Collect data
Step 2: House that data
Step 3: Analyse the data
Step 4: Implement data into products/branding/content/landing pages

Start simple and experiment.

Because the next stage of this evolution will be plugging your 1st party data into AI models.

So get ahead now before it’s too late.

Don’t make me say I told you so.
